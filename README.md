# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 - Golang 🎄

My first try coding with Go. My goal is not to write the most fancy one-liner or the most cryptic and short solution.
I want a readable and easy to follow code. I may not always use the best or most efficient algorithm, but I try my best.
Not using AI of course.

## 🏃‍♂ How to run

1. Put inputs in `inputs/` like `inputs/day01.txt`
2. `go run cmd/run/main.go -d <day>`

## 🕗 Results (only times, rounded to 1st decimal)
